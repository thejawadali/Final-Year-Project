"explanation": "Osteopenia or osteoporosis is where your bones are thinner and weaker than expected for your age, and are more likely to break or fracture. It is very common condition amongst all people, but some of the treatments for HIV and HIV itself makes those living with HIV more likely to having thin bones. Your doctor should check your risk of these conditions and may recommend a bone scan. You don’t necessarily need treatment unless your bones are very thin and you are at high risk of breaking bones.",

"explanation": "Bones need good levels of vitamin D and calcium to stay healthy. Vitamin D is made in the skin by sunlight and many people have low levels if they have darker skin and live in a country with less sunlight, your doctor may recommend vitamin D replacement if so. You can get enough calcium in your diet from dairy like cheese and milk, you don’t always need to take calcium supplements.

"explanation": "It is best to plan ahead and let your clinic know that you plan on going away so they can supply you with enough medications to take every day for the duration of your holiday. Missing doses or taking medication on alternate days is not advised because HIV can become “resistant” to the medications. This means the medication will no longer be able to control the virus, making it more difficult to treat in the future. Taking other people’s medications is not a good idea, they may not be the same medications as yours and it is very important to take your prescribed medications.",

"explanation": "When traveling abroad, it may sometimes be confusing to keep track of when to take medications. It is best to keep taking your medications every 24 hours if you take your medications once a day, or every 12 hours if you take them twice a day. However, this may not always be practical in a new time zone, for example, if your next dose is in the middle of the night in the new time zone. If this is the case, you can move your medications to the morning and continue taking it same time every day, and return to your original schedule when you return home.",
